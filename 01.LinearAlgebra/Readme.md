## Dot Product
Dot product is an algebraic operation in which two equal length vectors are being multiplied such that it produces a single number. Dot Product often called as inner product. This product results in a scalar number. Let’s consider two matrix a and b of same length, the dot product is done by taking the transpose of first matrix and then mathematical matrix multiplication of a’(transpose of a) and b is followed as shown in the figure below
