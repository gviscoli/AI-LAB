## Dot Product
Dot product is an algebraic operation in which two equal length vectors are being multiplied such that it produces a single number. Dot Product often called as inner product. This product results in a scalar number. Let’s consider two matrix a and b of same length, the dot product is done by taking the transpose of first matrix and then mathematical matrix multiplication of a’(transpose of a) and b is followed as shown in the figure below:

## Outer Product
The tensor product of two coordinate vectors is termed as Outer product. Let’s consider two vectors a and b with dimension n x 1 and m x 1 then the outer product of the vector results in a rectangular matrix of n x m. If two vectors have same dimension then the resultant matrix will be a square matrix as shown in the followed figure:
