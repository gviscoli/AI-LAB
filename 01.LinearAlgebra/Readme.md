## Dot Product
Dot product is an algebraic operation in which two equal length vectors are being multiplied such that it produces a single number. Dot Product often called as inner product. This product results in a scalar number. Let’s consider two matrix X and Y of same length, the dot product is done by taking the transpose of first matrix and then mathematical matrix multiplication of X’(transpose of X) and Y is followed as shown in the figure below:

## Outer Product
The tensor product of two coordinate vectors is termed as Outer product. Let’s consider two vectors X and Y with dimension n x 1 and m x 1 then the outer product of the vector results in a rectangular matrix of n x m. If two vectors have same dimension then the resultant matrix will be a square matrix as shown in the followed figure:

## Wise Product
Element-wise multiplication of two matrices is the algebraic operation in which each element of first matrix is multiplied by its corresponding element in the later matrix. Dimension of the matrices should be same. Consider two matrices a and b, index of an element in a is i and j then a(i, j) is multiplied with b(i, j) respectively as shown in the figure below
